# Evo - Evloution Simulator

## Goals

1. Stable simulation: the simulation should run (as long as possible) without all creatures dying.
2. Evolve intelligent creatures: after a while some creatures should react
"intelligently" to their surroundings.
3. High diversity: have as many differnt species coexisting
4. Develop social behaviours: creatures should have the possibility to develop
   social behaviours by interacting with each other

## Development

Run `make build` to build the binaries and `make watch` to build the binaries and
restart `evod` on file change.
